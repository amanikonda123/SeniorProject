What I love most is that it's unflavored, so I can mix it with literally anything- Smoothies, coffee, water, and it goes down smoothly with no clumping or grit. The biggest thing I tell people before they start taking creatine is to remember that they have to drink a tonnnn of water because it's meant to help build muscle, and if you don't it's not effective. What I like about this product besides it being unflavored is that it contains 100% creatine monohydrate, which is awesome for supporting explosive movements, muscle strengthening, and full power. It's also banned substance tested, which is really important to me. Each serving has 5g of pure creatine monohydrate, it helps support ATP recycling, which is really good for those explosive movements and for building strength, recovery, performance, and power when you work out daily and utilize it the way it's supposed to be used.

Optimum Nutrition's Creatine Monohydrate Powder is one of the most popular and trusted creatine supplements on the market. Known for its simplicity, effectiveness, and value for money, it's a go-to for athletes and fitness enthusiasts looking to enhance their strength and performance.

Ingredients & Purity:

This product features 100% pure micronized creatine monohydrate, which is the gold standard when it comes to creatine supplementation. It contains no fillers, artificial flavors, or additional ingredients, which ensures you're getting a clean and straightforward product. The micronized form helps the creatine dissolve more easily in water or other liquids, reducing clumping and making it easier to consume.

Performance & Effectiveness:

Creatine monohydrate is one of the most well-researched supplements, and Optimum Nutrition delivers the same proven benefits that creatine is known for. It helps to enhance strength, power output, and muscle endurance, making it ideal for high-intensity training, bodybuilding, and sports performance. Many users report noticeable improvements in their workout performance after consistent use, particularly in terms of lifting heavier weights and performing more reps.

As a daily supplement, it assists in increasing ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production, which fuels muscles during high-intensity workouts. Over time, users can expect to see gains in muscle mass and faster recovery, especially when combined with a solid nutrition and training program.

Taste & Mixability:

One of the key advantages of Optimum Nutrition's creatine is that it's unflavored, which makes it versatile. It can be mixed into water, juice, or a protein shake without altering the taste. In terms of mixability, the micronized powder dissolves relatively well in liquids, though there can be a slight gritty texture if not stirred or shaken thoroughly. Some users might notice minor residue at the bottom of their shaker, but it's not a significant issue.

Value for Money:

Optimum Nutrition offers great value with its creatine powder. A standard container provides a large number of servings (up to 114 servings for the 600g tub), and considering the effectiveness of the product, it is extremely affordable. Creatine is a long-term supplement, and this product's price makes it an economical choice for anyone on a budget.",love,[],0,0,,jasonb124,"{'contentLink': None, 'logoImageUrl': 'https://contentorigin.bazaarvoice.com/influenster/default/influenster.png', 'name': 'influenster.com'}",bazaarvoice,[]
