It expired in June of 2023. 
The expiration stamp is hard to read. But it's on the bottom. 
Now I understand why this was the cheapest per ounce that I could find for this exact type of Creatine. 
It's been just over 2 months. 
Walmart usually honors refunds up to 3 months.
I was just about to open this when I read the date.
I haven't opened it yet.
I will attempt a refund.

I work out regularly and use creatine intermittently as a pre-workout supplement. When I first researched different brands a few years ago, I decided on Optimum Nutrition (ON) and opted for their creatine in pill form, which I liked a lot. Creatine is widely recommended as an effective supplement for muscle growth, and after using it for several months, I found it beneficial, although its impact may vary depending on individual body types.
This particular product is in powder form—a white, tasteless powder that I mixed with about 8 ounces of water. However, it isn't very water-soluble, which is why I prefer the pill form. Because of this inconvenience, I rated it 4 stars. It's best to mix it with a more substantial base, such as a protein shake, as suggested on the label.

Creatine is widely recommended as an effective supplement for muscle growth, and after using it for several months, I found it beneficial, although its impact may vary depending on individual body types.
This particular product is in powder form—a white, tasteless powder that I mixed with about 8 ounces of water. However, it isn't very water-soluble, which is why I prefer the pill form.

It's made with pure creatine monohydrate, which is known for boosting strength and endurance. For me, one of the best parts is how it helps with muscle energy, especially during high-intensity exercises. I feel like I can push harder and recover faster between sets. It also mixes easily with water or protein shakes without that gritty texture some supplements have. Since it's unflavored, I can add it to almost anything. The only downside is that, like with most creatine, I've noticed a bit of water retention, but nothing major. Overall, I'm really happy with the results—it's been great for improving my strength and recovery.",Tastes unflavored so you can add to anything,[],0,0,,arcelh,"{'contentLink': None, 'logoImageUrl': 'https://contentorigin.bazaarvoice.com/influenster/default/influenster.png', 'name': 'influenster.com'}",bazaarvoice,[]
